🍽️ Zomato App with Cloud Storage — DevOps Project 🚀

1️⃣ Plan & Set Up Repository 📝🐙

Created a new GitHub repository to store the Zomato app source code.

Organized files and folders for app code, Docker, and Kubernetes manifests.



---

2️⃣ Set Up CI/CD with Jenkins 🤖⚡

Installed & configured Jenkins server.

Connected Jenkins with GitHub using webhooks for automatic builds.

Created a Jenkins pipeline to run the entire build, test, and deploy process.



---

3️⃣ Code Quality Analysis 🧹📊

Integrated SonarQube with Jenkins to check code quality.

Pipeline runs SonarQube scan after every commit to find bugs, code smells, and vulnerabilities.



---

4️⃣ Containerization 🐳📦

Used Docker to create a container image of the application.

Defined app dependencies and environment in a Dockerfile.

Built and tagged the Docker image in Jenkins.



---

5️⃣ Security Scanning 🛡️🔍

Scanned Docker image with Trivy to detect vulnerabilities.

Performed web application security testing with OWASP ZAP.



---

6️⃣ Push Image to Registry 📤📦

After security checks passed, pushed the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).



---

7️⃣ Deployment to Kubernetes ☸️🚀

Created Kubernetes manifests (deployment, service, ingress).

Jenkins deployed the application to the Kubernetes cluster.



---

8️⃣ GitOps with ArgoCD 🔄📂

Configured ArgoCD to watch the GitOps repository containing Kubernetes manifests.

Any changes to manifests in Git repo automatically synced to the Kubernetes cluster.



---

9️⃣ Cloud Storage Integration ☁️💾

Integrated Cloud Storage (AWS S3, GCP, or Azure Blob Storage) for storing restaurant images, food photos, and static assets.

Configured secure access policies for safe file handling.



---

🔟 Monitoring & Visualization 📈📊

Set up Prometheus to collect metrics from the Kubernetes cluster.

Used Grafana to create visual dashboards for application and infrastructure monitoring.



---

1️⃣1️⃣ Alerts & Maintenance 🚨🛠️

Configured alerts in Prometheus & Grafana for performance, errors, and downtime.

Monitored the application continuously and made improvements as needed.



---

🏁 Conclusion

This Zomato App with Cloud Storage project demonstrates the complete DevOps lifecycle — from code management and CI/CD automation to containerization, security, Kubernetes deployment, GitOps, and real-time monitoring. By integrating tools like Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Prometheus, Grafana, OWASP, and Trivy, the application is built, secured, deployed, and monitored in a fully automated manner.

The project not only ensures scalability, reliability, and security but also showcases how modern cloud-native applications can be efficiently developed and maintained using DevOps best practices. 🚀
